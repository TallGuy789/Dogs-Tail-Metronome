## Analysis of Specifications - Issues to Address

### Inconsistencies and Ambiguities

- [ ] **Duplicate button naming**: In UI spec "Copy Settings Button" appears twice - one for copy and one for paste. The second should be "Paste Settings Button"
- [ ] **Accent First Beat Toggle duplication**: This toggle appears in both Main Page (Row Misc) and Preferences Page (Audio Configuration). Clarify if these should be the same control or separate instances
- [ ] **Off Beat timing ambiguity**: Application spec doesn't clarify if Off Beat percentages are from the start of the beat interval or centered between beats
- [ ] **Beat counting inconsistency**: Off Beat mode uses spoken numbers ("1", "2", "3", "4") but doesn't specify if this respects the Accent First Beat mode or always counts from 1

### Missing Technical Requirements

- [ ] **Audio system specifications**: No details on audio backend, sample rate, bit depth, or latency requirements
- [ ] **Timing precision requirements**: While "great care" for timing is mentioned, no specific tolerance (e.g., Â±1ms) is defined
- [ ] **Platform compatibility**: No specification of target platforms (web, desktop, mobile)
- [ ] **Accessibility requirements**: No ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, or screen reader support mentioned
- [ ] **Error handling**: No specification for invalid input handling or audio system failures
- [ ] **Performance requirements**: No specifications for CPU usage, memory consumption, or battery impact

### Missing Functional Requirements

- [ ] **Settings persistence**: No specification of how user preferences are saved between sessions
- [ ] **Initial state behavior**: Default states for preferences page controls not fully specified
- [ ] **Volume interaction**: No clarification how Master Volume interacts with individual beat volumes
- [ ] **TTS voice configuration**: No specification of voice selection, language, or TTS engine preferences
- [ ] **Clipboard format**: Copy/Paste functionality mentioned but no format specification provided
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness**: UI layouts for different screen sizes not specified

### Missing UI/UX Details

- [ ] **Layout specifications**: No grid system, spacing, or responsive breakpoints defined
- [ ] **Visual feedback timing**: Beat visualization and color cycling timing not specified
- [ ] **Animation specifications**: No details on transitions, ease functions, or duration
- [ ] **Loading states**: No specification for app initialization or audio system loading
- [ ] **Focus management**: No keyboard navigation or focus order specified
- [ ] **Touch interaction**: No touch gestures or mobile-specific interactions defined

### Technical Implementation Gaps

- [ ] **Random number generation**: No specification of randomization algorithm or seed handling for consistent results
- [ ] **Audio scheduling**: No details on how to maintain timing accuracy across different browsers/platforms
- [ ] **Tap tempo algorithm**: "Sliding, weighted average" calculation not mathematically defined
- [ ] **Beat scheduling**: No specification of look-ahead scheduling for precise timing
- [ ] **Audio context management**: No details on handling audio context suspension/resumption

### Data Validation Requirements

- [ ] **Input validation rules**: Specific validation messages and behavior for out-of-range values
- [ ] **Bounds checking**: Behavior when incrementing/decrementing at min/max values
- [ ] **Cross-field validation**: No rules for interdependent field relationships
- [ ] **Clipboard validation**: No specification for validating pasted settings format

### User Experience Considerations

- [ ] **Status feedback**: Limited specification of what appears in the Status Label
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: No typography scale or visual importance guidelines
- [ ] **Color accessibility**: No consideration for color blind users or contrast requirements
- [ ] **Gesture conflicts**: No consideration for potential conflicts between tap tempo and other touch interactions
- [ ] **Orientation handling**: No specification for device orientation changes

### Documentation and Testing

- [ ] **Component documentation**: Need comprehensive prop, event, and slot documentation per coding guidelines
- [ ] **Unit testing strategy**: No testing requirements specified for critical timing functions
- [ ] **Integration testing**: No specification for testing audio timing accuracy
- [ ] **User acceptance criteria**: No clear success metrics for each feature

### Future Feature Clarity

- [ ] **Feature flag implementation**: No specification for how disabled future features should behave
- [ ] **Subdivision integration**: How subdivision controls will integrate with existing beat structure when implemented
- [ ] **Background cycling implementation**: Technical requirements for color cycling performance

## Recommendations

### High Priority
- [ ] Define precise audio timing requirements and implementation strategy
- [ ] Specify settings persistence mechanism and data format
- [ ] Clarify the relationship between duplicate Accent First Beat controls
- [ ] Define comprehensive input validation rules and error handling

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create responsive design specifications for mobile devices
- [ ] Define accessibility standards and implementation requirements
- [ ] Specify TTS configuration options and fallback behavior
- [ ] Document clipboard data format for copy/paste functionality

### Low Priority
- [ ] Define animation and transition specifications
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing strategy
- [ ] Specify performance benchmarks and optimization targets
- [ ] Plan integration strategy for future features
